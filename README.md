Abstract:
Servbot Dash is an endless runner, or infinite runner, built using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4 or “the engine”) and targeting the mobile platforms Android and iOS, due to their large and increasing market share. In essence, this project demonstrates the rapid prototyping capabilities of UE4’s blueprint visual scripting system (or “blueprints”) to rapidly implement game logic using the vast library of functions and methods built into the engine. With a tight deadline, rapid iteration and deployment was an important design consideration. In Servbot Dash, the player will maneuver the endlessly running character through the procedurally generated course, trying to gather as many gems as possible, while avoiding the obstacles and course walls for as long as possible.
